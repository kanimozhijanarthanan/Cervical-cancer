# Cervical Cancer Prediction Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

This project focuses on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict cervical cancer from cervical images. Cervical cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. CNNs, a class of deep neural networks, have shown promising results in image classification tasks and can be effectively applied to medical imaging for diagnostic purposes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of cervical images obtained from [provide source or dataset name]. The dataset includes images of various types of cervical cells, including normal cells and cells exhibiting pre-cancerous or cancerous changes.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- [Any other dependencies your project might require]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/cervical-cancer-prediction.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:

    [Describe any preprocessing steps required for the dataset, such as resizing, normalization, or augmentation.]

2. Train the CNN model:

    ```
    python train.py
    ```

    [You may need to adjust the parameters in the training script according to your dataset and model architecture.]

3. Evaluate the trained model:

    ```
    python evaluate.py
    ```

    [Explain how to evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.]

4. Predict with the trained model:

    ```
    python predict.py
    ```

    [Provide instructions on how to use the trained model for making predictions on new cervical images.]
